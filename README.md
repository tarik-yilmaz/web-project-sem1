🏨 GONDOR GRAND HOTEL, HOTEL PROJECT (1st Semester)

📘 About This Repository
This repository contains my very first semester project for a hotel reservation system. 
It demonstrates the basics of full-stack web development using HTML, CSS, PHP, and SQL.
**Fun Fact**: This project features a **Lord of the Rings** theme throughout its room names and decorative assets!

🌐 Technologies Used
• HTML & CSS for structuring and styling the web pages.
• PHP for server-side logic and form handling.
• SQL (MySQL) for database creation and management.

📂 Main Features
• Room Listings: Displays available rooms with details (type, price, capacity).
• Reservation Form: Allows users to make a booking request.
• Database Integration: All reservation details are stored in a MySQL database.
• Basic Validation: Ensures mandatory fields are filled before submission.

📌 How to Run
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Create a new MySQL database and import the provided database.sql file.
3. Update the database connection details in the `php/connect.php` file.
4. Run a local PHP server (e.g., using XAMPP/MAMP) and place this project inside the server's `htdocs` or `www` folder.
5. Access the project in your web browser at http://localhost/hotelproject (or similar path).

📌 Future Improvements
• User Authentication & Login
• Admin Panel for managing reservations
• More robust form validation (both front-end & back-end)
• Modernized UI/UX design
